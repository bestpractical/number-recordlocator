           use Number::RecordLocator;

           my $generator = Number::RecordLocator->new();
           my $string = $generator->encode("123456");

           # $string = "5RL2";

       "Number::RecordLocator" encodes integers into a 32 character "alphabet"
       designed to be short and easy to read and pronounce.  The encoding
       maps:

           0 to O
           1 to I
           S to F
           B to P

       With a 32 bit encoding, you can map 33.5 million unique ids into a 5
       character code.

       This certainly isn't an exact science and I'm not yet 100% sure of the
       encoding.  Feedback is much appreciated.

       nneeww

       Instantiate a new "Number::RecordLocator" object. Right now, we don't
       actually store any object-specific data, but in the future, we might.

       iinniitt

       Initializes our integer to character and character to integer mapping
       tables.

       eennccooddee IINNTTEEGGEERR

       Takes an integer. Returns a Record Locator string.

       ddeeccooddee SSTTRRIINNGG

       Takes a record locator string and returns an integer. If you pass in a
       string containing an invalid character, it returns undef.
